# minesweeper_automated

Idea is to automate minesweeper.online using pyautogui

Algorithm will be far from optimal. Goal is to successfully complete a game of expert difficulty.

**NOTE: Using macros in minesweeper.online IS against the rules and will result in an account ban**

I will be testing and using this program without an account. Therefore I will gain no advantage in game progression systems or leaderboards

--------------------------------

**EDIT:** Yeah looks like you should not use this program even without an account :D
